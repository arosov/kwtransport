[_JNI_ library for Kotlin/Java/KMP](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/issues/2672)
I think we might be able to use _JNI_ to implement the FFI layer for JVM-based languages. The main benefits are: it s faster, it gives us more low-level control, it s less magical than JNA s reflection ...

... that helps us understand the path to using the _JNI_ directly is also valuable, and it seems like this -- only pointers and potentially bit-packing -- doesn t lend itself to a direct _JNI_ future. Is that not a reasonable concern?
